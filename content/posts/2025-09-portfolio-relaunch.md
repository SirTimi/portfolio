So Welcome back i guess...

Been a while since i actually dropped something here lol(pardon my writing)

So it's currently 12.40 AM here and i'm waiting for customer support to respond concerning some server issues but while waiting i thought to get my hands busy with something..maybe something i have been procrastinating for a while or maybe take on something new for a change. But then i got hit with the biggest realization so far 

"I'M LIFTING A LOT OF WEIGHT WITH SO LITTLE CAPACITY"

It takes a lot for someone to come to that realization and then it's another thing for someone to say it out and try to look for a solution to it(BTW this is not a "pity me" moment so). 

Between showing up everyday for my personal brand(i dont even know the direction anymore), to thinking of new systems and ideas while I still have a pile of those in the background and everything inbetween, it's a crazy journey but then again one that requires so much discipline.

So, i've decided to do something that my overly ambitious self would hate to do...and that is to drop a lot of weight till i've sorted out the one's I need to prioritize. 

Is this one of those " I have to take a break from posting or doing other things to focus on my life" posts? Nope, far from it. But it is one of those things where I share my mind openly on how i plan to handle this  

Ultimately i've decided to go in fully as the systems builder who has his eyes out for ways to improve current existing systems or bringing up new ones while showing you guys how I do it, the struggles, insights, wins and more...would it be tough...YES!, but it's still not an excuse

So yeah...What you are now looking at is no longer my "Portfolio" alone, it's now HUB where I share everything..even resources and the likes. 

Why?

Because i've realized that authentic connection builds trust...because i'm not just looking for clients, NO...I'm looking to make an impact 

Stick around for more updates...Till then, Thanks for sticking around!
